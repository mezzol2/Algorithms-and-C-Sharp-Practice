# Algorithms-and-C-Sharp-Practice
This is a student repo that lets me practice implementing various algorithms and learn C#.

These algorithms were learned while taking Algorithms and Data Structures at the University of Oslo.

C# is a new language for me and is not taught during the first year of my bachelor's degree.
