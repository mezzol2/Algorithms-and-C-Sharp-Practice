This program implements the Selection Sort method in order to sort an array.

This algorithm sorts by finding the lowest value in the array, placing that value at the front of the array, and then successivly repeating this process for the second lowest, third lowest, etc. until it has gone through every value in the array.

The time complexity of this algorithm is quadratic or O(n^2).
